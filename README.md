# Face Detection using OpenCV

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements **face detection** using **OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier**. It detects faces in an image and highlights them with bounding boxes.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses OpenCV's pre-trained **Haar Cascade** model.
- Works on both images and live webcam feeds.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
